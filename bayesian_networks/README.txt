This file contains an experimentation with boostrapping a Bayesian Network to determine conditional probabilities for possible 
outcomes in patients dependent upon their previous medical history and establish confidence intervals for these probablities 
using a 5% significance level. 

The data that was used was a medical history file. 

The available fields were H (history of smoking), B (bronchitis is present), L (lung disease is present), 
F (patient is complaining of fatigue), and C (chest X-ray is positive).  All fields are coded Y or N.
