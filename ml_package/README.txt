This folder contains three files. 

1) The ml.py file which contains the `ml` module. 

   This module is designed to help relieve some of the complexity of deploying machine learning models
   using the `scikit-learn` library.

2) The other file is a jupyter notebook explaining its useage, with example.

3) Finally, test.py is just a copy of the full code from the jupyter notebook. 

In order to "install" the package, simply paste the file into your working directory 
and insert an `import ml` statement in your code.

Enjoy!
