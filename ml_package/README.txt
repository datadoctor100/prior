This folder contains two files. 

One is the ml.py file which contains the `ml` module. 

This module is designed to help relieve some of the complexity of deploying machine learning models
using the `scikit-learn` library.

The other file is a jupyter notebook explaining its useage, with example. 

In order to "install" the package, simply paste the file into your working directory 
and insert an `import ml` statement in your code.

Enjoy!
